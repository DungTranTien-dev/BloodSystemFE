# Bug Fix Summary - AddDonor Component Error Resolution

## Problem Description
**Error:** `ReferenceError: qrCodeUrl is not defined`
**Location:** AddDonor.jsx:148:9
**Impact:** AddDonor page completely broken, unable to load

## Root Cause Analysis
During the component refactoring process, the `qrCodeUrl` variable was referenced in the IdentityDocumentUpload component but was not properly defined or exported from the custom hooks. This happened because:

1. The original AddDonor component had `qrCodeUrl` defined inline
2. During refactoring, this variable was moved to useFileUpload hook
3. However, it wasn't properly exported from the hook
4. The AddDonor component was still trying to use `qrCodeUrl` without importing it

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated useFileUpload Hook (`src/hooks/useFileUpload.js`)
```javascript
// Added qrCodeUrl definition
const qrCodeUrl = 'https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/?size=150x150&data=' + 
  encodeURIComponent('https://bloodsystem.com/upload-mobile');

// Added handleFileChange function
const handleFileChange = (e) => {
  if (e.target.files && e.target.files[0]) {
    setIdentityFile(e.target.files[0]);
  }
};

// Updated return statement to include missing exports
return {
  identityFile,
  setIdentityFile,
  dragActive,
  setDragActive,
  qrCodeUrl, // âœ… Added
  handleDrop,
  handleDragOver,
  handleDragLeave,
  handleFileChange, // âœ… Added
  resetFile
};
```

### 2. Updated AddDonor Component (`src/pages/admin/AddDonor.jsx`)
```javascript
// Updated destructuring to include missing variables
const {
  identityFile,
  setIdentityFile,
  dragActive,
  setDragActive,
  qrCodeUrl, // âœ… Added
  handleDrop,
  handleDragOver,
  handleDragLeave,
  handleFileChange // âœ… Added
} = useFileUpload();
```

### 3. Fixed Secondary Issue - BloodRequests Icon Error
**Problem:** `FaDroplet` icon doesn't exist in react-icons/fa
**Solution:** Replaced with `FaTint` icon in BloodRequests.jsx

```javascript
// Before
import { FaArrowLeft, FaEye, FaCheck, FaTimes, FaSearch, FaDroplet } from 'react-icons/fa';
<FaDroplet className="mr-1" />

// After  
import { FaArrowLeft, FaEye, FaCheck, FaTimes, FaSearch, FaTint } from 'react-icons/fa';
<FaTint className="mr-1" />
```

## Testing & Verification

### 1. Build Test
```bash
npm run build
```
**Result:** âœ… Build successful (previously failed)

### 2. Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
**Result:** âœ… Server running on http://localhost:5176

### 3. Page Load Test
- **URL:** http://localhost:5176/admin/add-donor
- **Result:** âœ… Page loads without errors
- **Functionality:** âœ… All components render correctly

## Impact Assessment

### Before Fix
- ðŸ”´ AddDonor page completely broken
- ðŸ”´ Build process failing
- ðŸ”´ Development server showing runtime errors
- ðŸ”´ User cannot access donor registration functionality

### After Fix
- âœ… AddDonor page loads successfully
- âœ… Build process completes without errors
- âœ… All form components render correctly
- âœ… File upload functionality working
- âœ… QR code display working
- âœ… Component modularization maintained

## Lessons Learned

1. **Hook Completeness:** When creating custom hooks, ensure all used variables are properly exported
2. **Dependency Tracking:** During refactoring, maintain a checklist of all variables and functions being moved
3. **Icon Validation:** Verify icon names exist in the imported library before using
4. **Build Testing:** Run build process after major refactoring to catch compilation errors early

## Technical Notes

- **QR Code URL:** Generated using qrserver.com API for mobile upload functionality
- **File Upload:** Supports both drag-drop and file picker methods
- **Error Boundary:** React error boundary properly caught and displayed the error
- **Hot Module Replacement:** Working correctly after fix

---
**Status:** âœ… RESOLVED  
**Verification:** Page fully functional, all components working as expected  
**Next Steps:** Continue with additional features or testing as needed
